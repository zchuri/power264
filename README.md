# Generate Power264 brain atlas with R and FSL

Scripts to generate Power264 brain atlas based on 'fslr' R package.
Here there is the script (power264.R) with the commands needed to create this atlas, but you can find here the outputs in MNI space coordinates in 1 and 2mm resolution.
To run the entire script is necesary to have installed R and FSL, plus the 'Neuron_consensus_264.xlsx' file, you can find it in the author's website:
<https://www.jonathanpower.net/2011-neuron-bigbrain.html>

It is set to create spheres of 5 mm radious at the given MNI coordinates, but those parameters can be easily modify.
Cheers :)
